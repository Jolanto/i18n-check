# Changelog

See the [releases for i18n-check](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/releases) for an up to date list of versions and their release dates.

i18n-check tries to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version where increments are made of the:

- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes

Emojis for the following are chosen based on [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

## [Upcoming] i18n-check 1.0.0
