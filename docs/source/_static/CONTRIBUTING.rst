Learning the tech stack
-----------------------

``i18n-check`` is very open to contributions from people in the early stages of their coding journey! The following is a select list of documentation pages to help you understand the technologies we use.

**Docs for those new to programming**

- `Mozilla Developer Network Learning Area <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn>`_
    - Doing MDN sections for HTML, CSS and JavaScript is the best ways to get into web development!
- `Open Source Guides <https://opensource.guide/>`_
    - Guides from GitHub about open-source software including how to start and much more!

**Python learning docs**

- `Python getting started guide <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html>`_
- `Python getting started resources <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_

Development environment
-----------------------

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE setup in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is ready for development.

    | **Note**

    **Suggested IDE setup**

    VS Code

    Install the following extensions:

    - `charliermarsh.ruff <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff>`_
    - `streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`_

2. `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ the `i18n-check repo <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check>`_, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

- **Consider using SSH**

Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.

To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, ``https://github.com/...``, with the SSH one, ``git@github.com:...``.

- e.g. Cloning now becomes ``git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/i18n-check.git``

GitHub also has their documentation on how to `Generate a new SSH key <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_ ðŸ”‘

- **Using HTTPS**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/i18n-check.git
    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
    cd i18n-check
    # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check.git

- Now, if you run ``git remote -v`` you should see two remote repositories named:
    - ``origin`` (forked repository)
    - ``upstream`` (``i18n-check`` repository)

3. Create a virtual environment, activate it and install dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Unix or MacOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # After activating venv:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

    # To install the CLI for local development:
    pip install -e .

You're now ready to work on ``i18n-check``!

    | **Note**
    | Feel free to contact the team in the `Development room on Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/!CRgLpGeOBNwxYCtqmK:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=acter.global&via=chat.0x7cd.xyz>`_ if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

Linting
-------

For the backend `Ruff <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff>`_ is installed via the required packages to assure that errors are reported correctly. We'd also suggest that VS Code users install the `Ruff extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff>`_.

Testing
-------

Please run the following commands from the project root to test:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Format the src directory, lint the code and run static type checks:
    ruff format ./src
    ruff check ./src
    mypy ./src --config-file ./pyproject.toml

    # Run tests:
    pytest

    # To run a specific test:
    pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_function

    # To run with a coverage report as is done in PRs:
    pytest . --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=./pyproject.toml

Issues and projects
-------------------

The `issue tracker for i18n-check <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues>`_ is the preferred channel for `bug reports <#bug-reports>`_, `features requests <#feature-requests>`_ and `submitting pull requests <#pull-requests>`_. The activist community also organizes related issues into `projects <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/projects>`_.

Bug reports
-----------

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful â€” thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the latest ``main`` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository is *definitely* responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work, etc)

To make the above steps easier, the ``i18n-check`` team asks that contributors report bugs using the `bug report template <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=activist-org%2F1&template=bug_report.yml>`_, with these issues further being marked with the `Bug <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3ABug>`_ type.

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

Feature requests
----------------

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in its development. Feature requests are marked with the `Feature <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature>`_ type in the `issues <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues>`_.

Pull requests
-------------

Good pull requests â€” patches, improvements and new features â€” are the foundation of our community making ``i18n-check``. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under `the specified license <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/tree/main/LICENSE.txt>`_ and should follow the coding indentation and style standards (contact us if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the `GitHub flow <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow>`_ process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout <dev-branch>
    git pull upstream <dev-branch>

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>

3. Install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to ensure that each of your commits is properly checked against our linter and formatters:

.. code-block:: bash

    # In the project root:
    pre-commit install

    # Then test the pre-commit hooks to see how it works:
    pre-commit run --all-files

pre-commit is Python package that can be installed via pip or any other Python package manager. You can also find it in our `requirements-dev.txt <https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/tree/main/requirements-dev.txt>`_ file.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pre-commit

If you are having issues with pre-commit and want to send along your changes regardless, you can ignore the pre-commit hooks via the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit --no-verify -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_.

    | **Note**
    | The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨
    | - `commitlint <https://commitlint.io/>`_ helps write `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_
    | - Git's `interactive rebase <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase>`_ cleans up commits

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

.. code-block:: bash

    git push origin <topic-branch-name>

7. `Open a Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_ with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!
