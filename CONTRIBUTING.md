## Development environment [`â‡§`](#contents)

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE setup in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is ready for development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details><summary>Suggested IDE setup</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> VS Code
>
> Install the following extensions:
>
> - [charliermarsh.ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)
> - [streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
>
> </p>
> </details>

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [i18n-check repo](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/i18n-check.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/i18n-check.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd i18n-check
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (i18n-check repository)

3. Create a virtual environment, activate it and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Unix or MacOS:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   # After activating venv:
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

   # To install the CLI for local development:
   pip install -e .
   ```

You're now ready to work on `i18n-check`!

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [Development room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!CRgLpGeOBNwxYCtqmK:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=acter.global&via=chat.0x7cd.xyz) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

<a id="linting-"></a>

## Linting [`â‡§`](#contents)

For the backend [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) is installed via the required packages to assure that errors are reported correctly. We'd also suggest that VS Code users install the [Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff).

<a id="testing-"></a>

## Testing [`â‡§`](#contents)

Please run the following commands from the project root to test:

```bash
# Format the src directory, lint the code and run static type checks:
ruff format ./src
ruff check ./src
mypy ./src --config-file ./pyproject.toml

# Run tests:
pytest

# To run a specific test:
pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_function

# To run with a coverage report as is done in PRs:
pytest . --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=./pyproject.toml
```

## Issues and projects [`â‡§`](#contents)

The [issue tracker for i18n-check](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). The activist community also organizes related issues into [projects](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/projects).

<a name="bug-reports"></a>

## Bug reports [`â‡§`](#contents)

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful â€” thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository is _definitely_ responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work, etc)

To make the above steps easier, the i18n-check team asks that contributors report bugs using the [bug report template](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=activist-org%2F1&template=bug_report.yml), with these issues further being marked with the [`Bug`](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3ABug) type.

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

<a name="feature-requests-"></a>

## Feature requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in its development. Feature requests are marked with the [`Feature`](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature) type in the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check/issues).

<a name="pull-requests-"></a>

## Pull requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Good pull requests â€” patches, improvements and new features â€” are the foundation of our community making i18n-check. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](LICENSE.txt) and should follow the coding indentation and style standards (contact us if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that each of your commits is properly checked against our linter and formatters:

   ```bash
   # In the project root:
   pre-commit install

   # Then test the pre-commit hooks to see how it works:
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> pre-commit is Python package that can be installed via pip or any other Python package manager. You can also find it in our [requirements.txt](backend/requirements.txt) file.
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are having issues with pre-commit and want to send along your changes regardless, you can ignore the pre-commit hooks via the following:
>
> ```bash
> git commit --no-verify -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"
> ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨
>
> - [commitlint](https://commitlint.io/) helps write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
> - Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) cleans up commits

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!
